#installation/Setup

note: any python you run needs to be executable as a python script (don't choose to make a command).

1) run "script compiler" from under tools

2) Follow the prompts on compiler to setup project details

Note: currently only aware of adding one python file with all your code in it. 

3) once you run through the steps and build you will get two files

 The RHP file you can drag into a rhino to install. 
 
 The more interesting one is the .yak file. This file you can put on a cloud file sharing platform (Google Drive, DropBox etc) and distribute to othersthrough the package manager! See Will Pearson's instructions on adding it to your current package manager [here](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/yak/package-sources/). You can also take this and upoad to food4Rhino thought i have not tested that. 


please join the project and update with any useful bits you find!
